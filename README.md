# Akamai Insights Datasource Plugin

Use the Akamai Insights Datasource Plugin for Grafana to visualize and observe reporting data.

## Install Grafana 7.0 or newer

Install Grafana version 7.0 or newer. Please be aware, since your package manager may install an older version, it's best to refer to official documentation 
[Install Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) which covers the details of the Grafana installation process for various operation systems

## Obtain Akamai API credentials

"Akamai Insights Datasource Plugin" gets data from the
[https://techdocs.akamai.com/reporting/v2/docs/welcome-rpt](https://techdocs.akamai.com/reporting/v2/docs/welcome-rpt).

You need to create an "API Client" with authorization to use the
[https://techdocs.akamai.com/reporting/v2/docs/welcome-rpt](https://techdocs.akamai.com/reporting/v2/docs/welcome-rpt).

See the "Get Started" section of [Reporting API v2](https://techdocs.akamai.com/reporting/v2/reference/get-started)
which says, "To enable this API, choose the API service named reporting-api, and set the access level to READ-WRITE".

Follow directions at [Authenticate With EdgeGrid](https://developer.akamai.com/getting-started/edgegrid) to generate
the required client credentials.

A customized version of those directions follows:

* Go to [Control Center](https://control.akamai.com/)
* Navigate to the "Identity & Access" page.
* Press "New API Client for Me"

![New API Client](static/new-api-client.png)

* Select the "Advanced" option.
* Choose "Select APIs".
* Select "Reporting API" and "READ-WRITE" access.

![Reporting API](static/reporting-api.png)

* Press "Create API client"
* Copy the credentials (client_secret, host, access_token, and client token).

![Credentials](static/credential.png)

The credentials will later be entered into "Akamai Insights Datasource Plugin" configuration.

Note that Step 2 in [Authenticate With EdgeGrid](https://developer.akamai.com/getting-started/edgegrid)
"Decide which tool youâ€™ll use to make requests" is not necessary. "Akamai Insights Datasource Plugin" makes
the requests.
